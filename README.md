# Ergo S-1 ZMK Config

> NOTE: This repo is only used to generate keymaps. Use [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/arcanemachine/zmk-ergo-s-1) to build the actual firmware that gets loaded onto the keyboard.

This repo allows you to create a custom keymap for your [Ergo S-1 keyboard](https://github.com/wizarddata/Ergo-S-1).

To create a custom keymap, just fork this GitHub repo, then import it into the awesome [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) GUI web application (the application has a section that allows you to import the repo after you fork it). Use the Keymap Editor to create your keymap, then take that modified `config/ergo_s1_oe.keymap` file and build your custom firmware using the instructions in [my other GitHub repo](https://github.com/arcanemachine/zmk-ergo-s-1).

Special thanks to the creator of the Ergo S-1 keyboard!
